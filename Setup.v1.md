# Setup instructions v1

## Setting up new MCO

#### Reset Parity workspace

- Kill any running [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/releases) processes
- Open %User%\AppData\Roaming\Parity\Ethereum\keys\ and rename the ethereum or testnet directory holding keys, addresssbook and vault to a different name
- Because we want to test on the kovan testnet the "kovan" directory has been renamed to "kovan-backup" in the image below (you can skip this step if you don't have a kovan directory)
